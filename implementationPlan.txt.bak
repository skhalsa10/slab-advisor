## Prerequisites (Tasks for You to Complete)

Before development begins, please gather the following information:

### 1. Grading Service Pricing Research
- **PSA Pricing Plans**: Research current PSA grading costs for different service levels (Economy, Regular, Express, Super Express)
- **BGS/Beckett Pricing Plans**: Find current BGS pricing tiers and turnaround times
- **SGC Pricing Plans**: Research SGC pricing structure and service options
- **Additional Fees**: Note any additional fees (shipping, handling, insurance, etc.)

### 2. Business Model Decisions
- **Free Tier Limits**: Decide how many free scans per user (suggested: 3-5)
- **Pricing Strategy**: Choose between subscription vs pay-per-scan vs credit system
- **Card Types**: Decide which card types to support initially (all sports, specific sports, include non-sports like Pokemon/Magic)

### 2a. MVP Scope (DECIDED)
- **Collection Dashboard**: Simple list view with cards, grades, and pricing data
- **Required Data per Card**:
  - Card title and images
  - Estimated grade from Ximilar
  - Current ungraded market price
  - Estimated graded price at predicted grade
  - Price at grade above (if applicable)
  - Price at grade below (if applicable)
  - Date price was captured
- **Collection Features**:
  - Total ungraded portfolio value
  - Sort by price (high to low, low to high)
  - Sort by estimated grade (high to low, low to high)
  - Search by card title
- **No Advanced Analytics**: Charts and detailed analytics can wait for v2

### 3. Technical Preferences
- **LLM Service**: Choose between OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, or other
- **Design Direction**: Mobile-first or desktop-first approach preference
- **Brand Colors**: Any specific color scheme or branding preferences

### 3a. Image Storage Strategy (DECIDED)
- **Storage Service**: Supabase Storage (integrated with database/auth)
- **Bucket Structure**: `card-images/{user_id}/{card_id}/front.jpg` and `/back.jpg`
- **Image Requirements**:
  - Max size: 10MB per image
  - Formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
  - Recommended: 1200px max width for optimal quality/size balance
  - Auto-optimization available through Supabase CDN
- **Security**: Row Level Security policies ensure users only access their own images

### 3b. Error Handling & Edge Cases (DECIDED)
- **Failed Grading (Poor Image Quality)**:
  - Do NOT charge user credits
  - Show error message with image quality recommendations
  - Display optimal photo guidelines (good lighting, clean background, no glare)
  - Allow re-upload without penalty
- **Successful Grading, Failed Price/Title Detection**:
  - Save the grade estimate (user was charged for this)
  - Allow manual entry of card title and price
  - Provide "Request AI Price Insights" button for manual LLM search
  - Store partial data and allow completion later
- **Fallback Flow**: Grade ‚Üí Manual Title Entry ‚Üí Manual Price Entry ‚Üí Optional AI Insights

### 3c. User Experience Flow (DECIDED)
- **Upload Process**: Two separate uploads (front and back) but stored together as one card
- **Authentication Required**: Must create account and login to upload images
- **Free Tier**: 2 free card analyses for new users
- **Paywall Flow**:
  - Users can upload front/back images even without credits
  - "Analyze/Grade" button triggers paywall when credits exhausted
  - Must purchase credits to proceed with analysis
- **Credit System**: Pay-per-analysis model (not subscription)

### 3d. Data Privacy & User Control (DECIDED)
- **User Deletion Rights**: Users can delete any of their uploaded cards
- **Data Retention**: Retain all data indefinitely (users paid for the service)
- **Pricing Consideration**: Long-term storage costs may require hybrid model:
  - Pay-per-analysis for grading
  - Small subscription fee for collection storage/management
- **Storage Strategy**: Need to account for growing image storage costs in pricing

### 4. Backend Service Accounts to Create
- **Supabase Account**: Create account at supabase.com
  - Set up new project for Slab Advisor
  - Get API keys (anon public key and service role key)
  - Configure authentication providers
- **Stripe Account**: Create account at stripe.com
  - Complete business verification
  - Get API keys (publishable key and secret key)
  - Set up webhook endpoints (for later phases)
- **LLM Service Account**: Choose one:
  - **OpenAI**: Create account at platform.openai.com, get API key
  - **Anthropic**: Create account at console.anthropic.com, get API key
- **Vercel Account** (for deployment): Create account at vercel.com
  - Connect to GitHub repository
  - Set up environment variables for production

### 5. API Access Preparation
- **Ximilar API Documentation**: Have API docs ready for integration phase
- **Ximilar API Token**: Confirm API token is working and note any usage limits

### 6. Sample Data & Testing
- **Test Cards**: Gather 5-10 sample card images (front/back) for testing
- **Known Grades**: If possible, include cards with known grades for validation
- **Domain Name** (optional): Purchase domain name if desired (can use Vercel subdomain initially)
