- `fix:` Bug fixes  
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `style:` Formatting changes
- `docs:` Documentation updates
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

# Execute Git Commit

Analyze changes and create a commit with proper message formatting.

First, check the current status and changes:

<Bash>
<command>git status</command>
<description>Check uncommitted files</description>
</Bash>

<Bash>
<command>git diff</command>
<description>Review unstaged changes</description>
</Bash>

<Bash>
<command>git log --oneline -5</command>
<description>Check recent commit style</description>
</Bash>

Then analyze the changes and determine:
1. The type of change (feat/fix/refactor/etc)
2. The scope of change (component/module affected)
3. A concise description of what changed and why

Stage and commit the changes:

<Bash>
<command>git add -A</command>
<description>Stage all changes</description>
</Bash>

<Bash>
<command>git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Appropriate commit message based on changes]
