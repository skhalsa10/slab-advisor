# Execute Design Review

Use the Task tool to launch the design-review-changes agent to conduct a comprehensive review of uncommitted UI/UX changes.

<Task>
  <description>Design review of uncommitted changes</description>
  <subagent_type>design-review-changes</subagent_type>
  <prompt>
    Conduct a comprehensive design review of all uncommitted UI/UX changes in this repository.
    
    Follow your systematic review process:
    1. Check git status and diff to identify uncommitted changes
    2. Start the development server if not running
    3. Test the live experience at http://localhost:3000
    4. Validate visual quality, responsiveness, and accessibility
    5. Capture screenshots as evidence
    6. Check browser console for errors
    
    Focus specifically on uncommitted front-end modifications and provide a detailed report categorizing issues by severity (Blockers, High Priority, Improvements, Notes).
    
    Include your final recommendation on whether the changes are ready to commit.
